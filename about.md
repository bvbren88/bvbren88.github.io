Dear Brenda,

Happy Birthday!  I want you to know that you are the most special and amazing person in my life, and that I wouldn't change a thing about you.  I hope there is nothing but love and happiness on this day :)

I wanted to create this site for you, so that you have a place that's live to the world, where you can put you amazing photos, and even share some of your beautiful poetry if you felt so inclined.  We can make this site anything you want, and I can do it, or I can show you how to.  You'll see, it's not as mystical as it seems.

Brenda, you are the greatest thing that has ever happened to me.  I know we have our difficulties and challenges, as every couple no doubt does.  But, I want you to know that I have faith that our love with preservere even through the roughest storms.  I have faith that we will find that elusive balance in our lives and marriage, and be truly happy together, all three of us.

I hope this is a good gift for you.  I can buy you some stuff too if you want, but this one is from the heart.  I hope this birthday is everything you want it to be and more.

I love you with all of my heart.

Your husband,

David Ruby Morfin Givens
