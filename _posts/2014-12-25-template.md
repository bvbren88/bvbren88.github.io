This is where you write your blog.  Nothing else is needed except the words you want to write.

If you want a new paragraph, just make sure there is an empty line between each block of text.

This is how you add a [link]( http://www.thefreedictionary.com/word).

This is how you insert an image: ![Jezliah](/photos/jezliah.jpg)

Remember to save your post in date format.  This way, it will automatically arrange them on the site from newest to oldest.  Like this: 2014-12-25-title.md
